        "Q.1 - **Explain the key feature of Python that makes it a popular choice for programming.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans.**- Python's popularity stems from its simplicity, versatility, and great ecosystem. Python's syntax is clean and easy to read, which reduces the learning curve for beginners. Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is excuted line by line without the need for compilation. This makes testing and debugging easier. Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides modules for handling regular expressions. Python also has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries e.g NumPy for scientific computing, Pandas for Data analysis. Python is platform independent, meaning that python program can run on any operating system (window, macOS,Linux) without modification. This makes it a great choice of building cross-platform applictions.In conclusion, Python's simplicity, vesratility, and storg ecosystem of tools make it an excellent choice for beginners and experts.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Ans.**- In Python predefined keywords (also known as reserved words) are special words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used for any other purpose, such as naming variables or functions. They form the syntax and structure of the Python language, defining how the code is interpreted by the Python interpreter. for example (if, else, elif, for, while, def, exept, with, as, break, true, false, none etc.).\n",

        "- Exception Handling: Keywords like try, except, finally, and raise are used for handling exceptions and errors.\n",
        "- Context Management: The with keyword is used for resource management, ensuring that resources are properly cleaned up after use.\n",
        "- Boolean Values: True, False, and None are used to represent truth values and null values in the language."

        "\n",
        "**Mutable objects** are those whose state or value can be changed after they are created. Examples include lists, dictionaries, and sets.Their contents can be modified without creating a new object.They often provide methods for adding, removing, or changing elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Immutable objects** are those whose state or value cannot be changed after they are created. Examples include strings, tuples, and frozensets. Any operation that modifies an immutable object will create a new object instead of changing the existing one. They are often safer to use in multi-threaded programs since their state cannot change unexpectedly.\n",
