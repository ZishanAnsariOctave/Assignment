        "\n",
        "**Ans.** - The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Encapsulation*: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called an object. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps protect the object's integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Abstraction*: Abstraction allows programmers to hide complex implementation details and expose only the necessary features of an object. This simplifies interactions and helps in managing complexity by focusing on high-level functionalities rather than specific details.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Inheritance*: Inheritance enables a new class (derived or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (base or parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Polymorphism*: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to behave differently based on the object that it is acting upon, typically through method overriding and overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "- *Composition*: Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, allowing for a flexible and modular structure. It emphasizes a \"has-a\" relationship, as opposed to inheritance's \"is-a\" relationship, fostering code reuse and separation of concerns."
